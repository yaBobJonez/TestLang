# TestLang

*This project is being rewritten from scratch in C++. Don't expect any updates on the repo till I make the new version publically available.*

Some info:

Chime is a tiny dynamically-typed object-oriented simple programming language, based on Python, C++, Rust, and PHP but with some unique features.

Currently supports:
- If/Unless, Branched-if, Match
- For, Foreach, While/Until, Do-while/Do-until
- Ranges, Break/Continue nested
- Most basic operators (ternary, binary, and unary)
- Functions/procedures with varargs
